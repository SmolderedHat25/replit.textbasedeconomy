# [SCRATCH] Text - Based Economy BACKEND

This is the backend of the famous project "Text - Based Economy" on scratch.mit.edu made by @Air_heads. 
It is a game which sends data back and forth from the Scratch API and a python server. This is the code that runs in the python server, and responds to the scratch server's requests. It may seem impossible to connect python with Scratch, but through the use of cloud variables and the Scratch API, it is possible. Enjoy!
